# Personal LSCHS
This was my final project due while a sophomore at La Salle College High School for Introduction to Visual Studio. I recently opened it again and simplified the code  a lot, calling a function for repeated actions instead of repeating code, saving and loading of GPA inputs, and more.

## Libraries Used
* JSON.net

## Why?
Because this was a final project due. I picked it up again after getting frustrated with online websites that not only had different Letter Grade/Percentage to GPA values, but also the websites never saving my inputs. Making me waste a good 2 minutes opening my gradebook, opening the student handbook, and by hand converting each percentage to a letter grade and adding it to the website. Just save and load now!
